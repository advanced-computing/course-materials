**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I am taking this class to improve my coding skills. I really enjoy working with data and using it to enchance political analysis. I enjoy challenging myself and learning new things, which is why I enjoyed CIC. My hope is to use these skills when I start work after graduation. I also think that coding can be a fun creative outlet, which is sometimes missing in our field! 

**Favorite snack:** A good soda, usually Dr. Pepper
