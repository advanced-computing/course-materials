**Program:** Master of Public Administration

**Concentration/minor:** Data Science for Policy

**Background:** government, finance, data science

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I'm taking this class because I really had a meningfull time in the previous class (Computing in Context), and I found that this class offers a board range of courses related to data engineering, something that I also encounter a lot in office, but mostly using SQL. Iwant to be better in my data science job when I go back to my office, so this class is a good option for me.
One dream job is working on enhancing global trade chain through data science

**Favorite snack:** spicy chips
