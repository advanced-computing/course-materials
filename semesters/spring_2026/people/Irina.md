**Program:** MPA

**Concentration/minor:** Major in CEE, Minor in DSP

**Background:** Consultant, Strategy, and investment intern in different companies/areas (Internet, pharmaceuticals, finance, technology...)

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**
I wanna get a profound knowledge of Python and during last semester's class, I gained the basic foundation of coding, and with the help of ai, I could build a functional program on my own, which is super amazing. 

My dream job is to open a bakery shop, which is not relevant to coding or anything. But to be realistics, I would love to become a consultant, owning a problem-solving mind and tackle with problems in different areas. And when I earn enough money, I would retire and open a bakery shop, making coffee and cakes every day.

**Favorite snack:** Nougat
