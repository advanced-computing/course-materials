# Aria Kovalovich

**Program:** Master of International Affairs, Columbia School of International and Public Affairs

**Concentration** Data Science for Policy

**Minor** Energy Transition

**Background** 
Before SIPA, I spent seven years as a staffer in the U.S. Congress focused on drafting climate legislation and conducting oversight over government agencies and companies related to environmental issues.

**Why are you in this class?**
When in government, I was responsible for several projects that would have been much easier had someone on the team had computational and data science skills.  Because so few people on the Hill and in policy generally have that background, I wanted to find a way to return to graduate school to round out my skills in that area. I chose SIPA and DSP because they allow me to do just that while filling in some knowledge gaps within climate policy.

**Do you have a dream project/job?** 
I'd really like to get some experience working on renewable energy deployment; the next time there is a U.S. Administration friendly to strengthening federal climate policy, I would love to go back to federal government.

**Favorite snack** I am a popcorn fiend!
