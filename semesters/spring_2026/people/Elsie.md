**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I am in this class because I've heard that we will be learning more about API this semester. I have an interest in learning more about API, as I have previously encountered SEO at work and I would like to know more about it. My dream job is to participate in projects or programs that helps to improve certain parts of the world, whether it's on tech or infrastructure.

**Favorite snack:** Magnum mint choc ice cream
