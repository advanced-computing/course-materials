# Hi, I'm Romain 

**Program**: MPA
**Year**: 2025

**Background**: I'm from Belgium, pretty new to coding but learning to like it. Lived here and there the past few years, between Rome, Brussels, and Cape Town. I worked in management consulting before. I love cooking and freediving. 

**worst traits**: Impatience, coding has been testing my limits.
