**Background:** Worked in the Singaporean Civil Service, have a economics/public policy academic background.

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I’ve  been vibe coding a few small projects and also working on an app with a couple of software engineers. I’ve been having a great time, but I’m increasingly realizing I can’t keep progressing (or collaborating effectively) without a stronger grasp of the basics. For example, I encountered my first pull request last week and was embarrassingly confused about how to review it properly and what “good” Git/GitHub workflow looks like in practice.

I read the syllabus for Advanced Computing for Policy (DSPC7160IA) and it feels like exactly what I need - going deeper on data structures/algorithms, and also covering the “real world” tooling (databases, cloud services, collaboration workflows) that I’m already running into as soon as projects become even slightly serious.



**Favorite snack:** Not a huge snacker, but love me some coffee...
