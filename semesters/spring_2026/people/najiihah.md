**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I enjoyed Computing in Context last semester and I'm keen to go deeper and understand how computing can help answer or address policy issues. I'm hoping to work in the tech policy space and believe that understanding the technical concepts behind the scenes would help me in doing so.

**Favorite snack:** Keropok!
