**Program:** MPA

**Concentration:** International Finance and Economic Policy
**Background:** Journalism, international relations

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**
I’m taking this class to deepen my technical understanding of computational skills that can be leveraged in policymaking. In addition, as someone who is still new to coding, I found Computing in Context last semester particularly interesting. For those reasons, I’m taking this class as I continue learning how to apply these practical skills effectively in my day-to-day work, not only to support economic analysis, but also to strengthen my broader problem-solving toolkit.

Beyond professional settings, I’m also interested in applying coding in creative fields, such as music writing.

**Favorite snack:** Potato chips
