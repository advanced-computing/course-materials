**Program:** Economics and Education PhD 1st year 

**Background:** Development economics, education policy, think tank research 

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I'm interested in this class because I work with data all the time, but have little experience working with best-practice data engineering tools (like GitHub, etc)

One dream job is working with governments in Latin America to improve access to high-quality education. 

**Favorite snack:** Sour patch kids
