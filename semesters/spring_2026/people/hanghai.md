**Program:** MPA

**Concentration/minor:** Data Science for Policy (DSP)

**Background:** Business and technology management

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I want to build practical coding skills and learn how to use data to solve real policy and business problems. I also hope to understand how data is collected, cleaned, and deployed in real workflows. In the long run, I want to work in a role that connects policy, analytics, and product execution.

**Favorite snack:** Anything salty (chips).
