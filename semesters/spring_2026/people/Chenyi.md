Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?

I am taking this course to further develop my Python and quantitative skill set. Last semester, I gained substantial experience through Computing in Context with Professor Feldman, which encouraged me to continue building a stronger technical foundation. This spring semester feels like the right time to deepen my proficiency in Python and Git as I prepare for my summer internship.

Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to work in an international company and apply my finance and technology expertise to support cross-border or global initiatives. I am still refining the specific career path, but this course is an important step toward that direction.
