# Xingyi Wang

**Program:** MIA

**Concentration/minor:** ISD; DSP

**Background:** Political science, literature

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I’m taking this class because I want to become genuinely fluent in computing, not just as a user of tools but as someone who understands how systems work under the hood. For policy, I think that matters a lot: without technical literacy, it’s easy to design regulations that miss how technologies are actually built and deployed. Advanced computing feels like a way to close that gap and make my policy thinking more grounded and credible. 

**Favorite snack:** green beans
