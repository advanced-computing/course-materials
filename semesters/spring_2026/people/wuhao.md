**Program:** MPA

**Concentration/minor:** Data Science for Policy

**Background:** Information Systems and Operations Management, Data Analytics, Data Science

**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I’m in this class because I want to strengthen my ability to design end-to-end data systems that support real-world policy and organizational decision-making. I already have experience using Python for data analysis, but I want to go beyond analysis and understand how data is collected, structured, engineered, and deployed at scale.

My longer-term goal is to work in a data-driven policy or strategy role, where I can translate complex datasets into actionable insights for governments, public institutions, or mission-driven organizations. A dream project would be building a data pipeline that integrates messy administrative or economic data from multiple sources and turns it into clear, trustworthy insights that inform policy design or resource allocation.

**Favorite snack:** I don't like snacks.
