# Google Cloud

Do these one-time setup steps to ensure you don't have to pay for Google Cloud use for this class. Credits are provided through the [Google Cloud for Education](https://cloud.google.com/edu/faculty) program.

A [Google Cloud Project](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview#projects) has been created for your [course Project team](project_teams.csv), which the instructors have access to for troubleshooting. You redeem the credits, which creates a Billing Account. Someone then needs to associate their Billing Account with the existing Google Cloud Project, where the credits will be used to cover the group work.

1. Retrieve the coupon code — you'll be sent a link.
1. [Redeem the credits](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/edu-grants#redeem) - [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AnX7BX-qew)
   1. Fill in the form.
      - Use your UNI for your email, not an [alias](https://www.cuit.columbia.edu/email/email-aliases).
   1. When you get to [the GCP Credit Application screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/education), **make sure you've [switched to your Columbia Google account](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2405894)**.
1. [Dismiss the Free Trial banner — shouldn't need a credit card](https://services.google.com/fh/files/helpcenter/cloud_edu_free_trial_warning.pdf)
1. Confirm the credits were applied.
   1. Go to [the Billing Accounts page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).
   1. Click `Billing Account for Education`.
   1. In the sidebar, click `Credits`.
   1. You should see an `Advanced Computing for Policy` credit for $50.
1. Switch to your Google Cloud Project.
   1. In the top navigation bar, on the left side, click the drop-down.
   1. You should see a `Select a resource` modal pop up.
   1. Click the `ALL` tab.
   1. Click `sipa-adv-c-<name1>-<name2>`.
1. One person per Project team: [Change the Billing Account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#how-to-change-ba) to `Billing Account for Education`.

## Accidentally redeemed the credit with the wrong Google account

If you missed the step above about switching to your Columbia Google account, the easiest fix is to follow [these steps](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/grant-access-to-billing#update-cloud-billing-permissions) and make your `<uni>@columbia.edu` user a `Billing Account Administrator` on the `Billing Account for Education`.

## Use of Google Cloud outside this class

If you're using Google Cloud for something outside of this Project/class, we suggest [creating a separate Project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) to keep things isolated. The `Billing Account for Education` is yours, so you're welcome to [associate it with other Google Cloud Projects](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#how-to-change-ba) to use those credits.

We won't use the full $50 credit for this class, so you're welcome to take advantage of the remainder for other things. If you use it up, you'll start spending against your [Free Trial](https://cloud.google.com/free). Beyond that, you'll have to [pay](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/payment-methods).
