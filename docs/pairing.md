# Pair programming

[General information.](https://dev.to/documatic/pair-programming-best-practices-and-tools-154j#best-practices-for-pair-programming) Short summary:

- Two people in each pairing session is ideal, three is ok
- Virtual is possible, in-person is better
- There are two roles:
  - **Driver:** The person with their hands on the keyboard+mouse
  - **Navigator:** Watching, asking questions, making suggestions
    - Careful of [back-seat driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-seat_driver)
- Timing:
  - Switch roles every 15-20 minutes
  - Time driving should be shared roughly equally
    - Err on the side of the person who's less confident having more time driving
  - Take breaks every 30-40 minutes
- Both people are sharing one screen; put other devices away
