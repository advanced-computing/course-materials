# Teaching Assistant (TA) Guide

The TA is there to help students improve their coding and data analysis skills, lead labs, ensure student questions get answered, and perform grading.

- [General information on SIPA Assistantships.](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/students/resources-sipa-students)
- [Schedule](../README.md#schedule)
- Notifications:
  - You may want to tweak your [Ed Discussion notification settings](https://edstem.org/us/settings/notifications).
  - You will want to [turn on notifications for assignment comments](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Notification-when-student-posts-a-comment-on-an-assignment/m-p/405572#M142680).

## Time commitment

- Attending the full lectures (on time) and leading the lab session in-person for your assigned section each week
- Holding office hours for two hours each week
  - At least one hour should be a set time, the remainder can be by appointment
  - Can be virtual or in-person
- Weekly meeting with the instructor
- Grading and student support between classes can be done on your own schedule

## Responsibilities

- Reviewing assignment submissions, ideally within five days, checking if:
  - They completed the assignment requirements
  - There’s anything that arises that would be worth sharing with / clarifying for the whole class
- Being responsive to questions and direction from the instructor
- Helping continue to grow this class, providing recommendations on improvements to the course material/processes
- Taking attendance
- Grading assignments, including reading responses
- Leading [labs](../labs/)
  - Those materials are meant as a guide / objectives; you can adapt as you see fit.
  - You can just do live demo, make slides... up to you.
  - You're more than welcome to incorporate your own experience/background/research — students tend to like that.
- Responding to student questions
  - [Keeping an eye on Discussions](#discussions)

## One-time setup

- [ ] Set up office hours in the shared calendar.
- [ ] Do [the same one-time setup the students do](../readings/week_02.md#one-time-setup).
- [ ] Look ahead at the [labs](../labs/), as you'll be leading them.
- [ ] Ensure your environment is set up to match the students.
  - [Lab 1](../labs/lab_01.md)

### Assignments

Each [reading](../README.md#readings), part of the [Project](project.md), and [Lab](../labs) should have:

- [ ] [An Assignment in CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/233896/assignments)
  - [ ] Link to the corresponding Markdown file/heading
  - [ ] `Due` date matches [the schedule](../README.md#schedule)
  - [ ] `Until` date matches the [late work cutoff](../README.md#assignment-scoring-details)
  - [ ] [Rubric is attached](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-rubric-to-an-assignment/ta-p/1058)
  - [ ] [Published](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-publish-or-unpublish-an-assignment-as-an-instructor/ta-p/585)
- [ ] For [readings](../README.md#readings) and [the Project Part 1](project.md#part-1): A post for the responses, scheduled to go out in [Ed](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/233896/external_tools/37606?display=borderless) after the prior class
  - [ ] Link to [the corresponding Markdown file](../readings/)
  - [ ] Pin to the top so it's easy for people to find.
- [ ] Grading Policy Settings (under Grades tab)
  - [ ] **Late Policies:** Check "Automatically apply deduction to late assignments"
  - [ ] **Grade Posting Policies:** Automatic

## Weekly cadence

- Attending class
- [Recording attendance](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-the-Roll-Call-Attendance-Tool/ta-p/59#take_attendance)
- Grading assignment submissions and releasing grades
  - Recommend waiting until the submission deadline to start grading, to avoid issues with students who may have been intending to continue working on it

### Check-in meeting

1. How did the [Lab](../README.md#schedule) go?
1. How's the workload?
1. Anything you need clarification on?
1. Any Discussions the instructor should jump in on?
1. What came up in Lab/Discussions/assignments (common problems, etc.) that might be useful to cover in class?
1. Are all cells in the [gradebook](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/233896/gradebook) filled in (through last week)?
1. Are all the Assignments created that need to be?
1. Plan for [upcoming lab](../README.md#schedule)

## Student interactions

When troubleshooting, we are trying to strike a balance between students getting accurate answers quickly and encouraging students to work through things on their own / help one another to cement their learning. We want to try giving them _just enough_ hints to figure it out without giving them the answer. If they seem totally lost, direct them to [office hours](../README.md#meeting-datestimes).

Don't spend a _ton_ of time trying to figure out something that you don't understand; feel free to escalate to the instructor.

We have [a Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/columbia.edu/g/advanced-computing-for-policy-all/about), advanced-computing-for-policy-all@columbia.edu, [managed through Grouper](https://www.cuit.columbia.edu/grouper).

### [Discussions](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/233896/external_tools/37606?display=borderless)

- [Help page](https://edstem.org/us/help/using-ed-discussion)
- Ensure Discussion questions have answers within [the specified timeline](../README.md#communications).
  - Wait 24 hours to respond to questions that could be answered by another student, giving them a chance to do so.
    - Make sure homework questions have an answer within 48 hours, since they are time-sensitive.
    - Within 24 hours of when homework is due, answer questions as soon as possible to get students unstuck.
- Please give corrections/clarifications on student answers where necessary.

### Grading

[How to grade in CourseWorks](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-SpeedGrader/ta-p/757)

- Grading is done through [SpeedGrader](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-is-SpeedGrader/ta-p/13).
  - For Colab: You can leave comments on particular cells through the interface.
- If you're having trouble accessing the notebook in Google Colab, make sure the URL doesn't include an `authuser` [parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/What_is_a_URL#parameters).
- [How to give extensions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-assign-an-assignment-to-an-individual-student/ta-p/717#assign_to_student_only)
  - Grant any request for 1-2 days made before the deadline; escalate others to the instructor.
  - Set the `Until` date to the original [late submission deadline](../README.md#schedule) or the new due date, whichever is later.

### Plagiarism

Per the [Code of Academic and Professional Conduct](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/academic-policies/academic-and-professional-conduct/):

> It is the responsibility of all members of the SIPA community to encourage academic integrity and to deter, confront, and report all acts of academic dishonesty.

See [the class policies](../README.md#academic-integrity) for more details for what constitues plagiarism vs. fair reuse.

It isn't your responsibility to look for potential instances of cheating/plagiarism. That said, if you have suspicions of those occuring, you must report them to the instructor. Things you might notice:

- Use of a package we haven't covered in class
- Using a technique we didn't cover in class
- Multiple student submisions:
  - Being identical
  - Solving a problem in the same unusual way
