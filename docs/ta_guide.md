# Teaching Assistant (TA) Guide

The TA is there to help students improve their coding and data analysis skills, lead recitations (a.k.a. labs), ensure student questions get answered, and perform grading. [General information on SIPA Assistantships.](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/students/resources-sipa-students)

## Time commitment

- Attending the full lectures (on time) and leading the recitation session in-person for your assigned section each week
- Holding office hours for two hours each week
  - At least one hour should be a set time, the remainder can be by appointment
  - Can be virtual or in-person
- Weekly meeting with the instructor
- Grading and student support between classes can be done on your own schedule

## Responsibilities

- Reviewing assignment submissions, ideally within five days, checking if:
  - They completed the assignment requirements
  - There’s anything that arises that would be worth sharing with / clarifying for the whole class
- Being responsive to questions and direction from the instructor
- Helping continue to grow this class, providing recommendations on improvements to the course material/processes
- Taking attendance
- Grading assignments, including reading responses
- Leading [labs](../labs/)
  - Those materials are meant as a guide / objectives; you can adapt as you see fit.
  - You can just do live demo, make slides... up to you.
  - You're more than welcome to incorporate your own experience/background/research — students tend to like that.
- Responding to student questions
  - Keeping an eye on Discussions

## Assignment setup

Each [reading](../README.md#readings), part of the [Project](project.md), and other one-off assignment should have:

- [ ] [An Assignment in CourseWorks](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/210480/assignments)
  - [ ] Links to the corresponding info in this repository
  - [ ] Due date matches [the schedule](../README.md#schedule)
- [ ] For [readings](../README.md#readings): A post scheduled to go out in [Ed](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/210480/external_tools/37606?display=borderless) after the prior class, linking to [the Markdown file](../readings/)

## Weekly check-in

We'll use [the same format as the Python course](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/meta/assistant_guide.html#check-in-meeting).
