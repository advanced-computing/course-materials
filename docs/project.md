# Project

As stated in the [course description](../README.md#course-description):

> Over the semester, students will build a complex end-to-end data system.

This will incorporate:

- Automated data ingestion
- A database
- Web-based data visualization

â€¦all in the cloud.

## Expectations

- All code is peer-reviewed, through [pair programming](pairing.md) and/or pull requests.
- All team members are contributing equal amounts.
- It leverages at least one [dataset that's regularly updated](data.md#datasets-that-are-regularly-updated).
- _More to come_

## Teams

1. [Alexa](../people/alexachan.md) and [Giulio](../people/giulio.md)
1. [Angel](../people/angel.md) and [Krishna](../people/Krishna.md)
1. [Arnav](../people/arnav.md) and [Fred](../people/fred.md)

1. Ibrahim and [Isaura](../people/isaura.md)
1. [Naga](../people/naga.md) and [Will](../people/willfrolich.md)

## Part 1

The goals here are to pick an initial:

- Problem space
- Dataset

Part of this project is getting experience with automated data ingestion. Doing so is more interesting with data that changes. Therefore, pick a [dataset that's regularly updated](data.md#datasets-that-are-regularly-updated). You can incorporate additional datasets in the future.

None of this is set in stone, it can all be changed later.
