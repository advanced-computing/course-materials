# Week 2 readings

[General information](../README.md#readings)

## One-time setup

Please do the following:

- If on Windows:
  1. Install / confirm you have [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), particularly Git BASH.
     - There are a _lot_ of options in the installer - safe to stick to the defaults.
  1. In the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/getting-started), [`Select Default Profile`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/profiles) to be `Git BASH`. If you just installed Git BASH and it isn't appearing in the drop-down, try restarting VSCode.
