# Lecture 11 - IN PROGRESS

**Data engineering, continued**

---

We're going to revisit a number of concepts from earlier.

---

What can go wrong in data loading/manipulation? What errors/bugs have you hit?

---

What would you want to happen?

---

## Process mapping

---

### DAGs

**Directed acyclic graphs**

What does that mean?

---

## Online vs. offline data processing

- Batch jobs
- [Online analytical processing (OLAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing)
- [Online transaction processing (OLTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing)

---

## Pipelines

- Useful for complex [ETL](lecture_10.md#overview)
- Dependencies
- Assets
- Data
- Code (continuous integration/deployment)

---

## Persistence

Why store the data?

---

## Data lake/warehouse

## [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)

There are _many_ [alternative data integration / workflow orchestration tools](https://www.pracdata.io/p/open-source-data-engineering-landscape-2025).
