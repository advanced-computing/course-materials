## Modules

_Files!_

Let's refactor [`test_phone.py`](../examples/phone/test_phone.py).

## Refactoring

---

How have you been organizing data?

## Data structures

> a _data structure_ is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

[Encyclopedia of Computer Science, 2003](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.5555/1074100.1074312)

---

What data structures exist in Python?

---

## Abstraction

---

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## Code complexity

---

## Linting

---

## Code/test coverage

[pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html)

---

```sh
pytest --cov --cov-report html
open htmlcov/index.html
```
