## Intros

The hard way! Hitting the ground running.

1. Accept the invite to [the GitHub Organization](https://github.com/advanced-computing), if you haven't already.
   - You should show up in [the list of People](https://github.com/orgs/advanced-computing/people).
1. [Open the repository.](https://github.com/advanced-computing/course-materials)
1. [Make your own Markdown file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository#adding-a-file-to-a-repository-on-github) under [`semesters/spring_2026/people/`](../semesters/spring_2026/people/), based on [Aidan's](../semesters/spring_2026/people/aidan.md).
   - Include nickname / what you'd like to be called
   - The more specific the better.
   - [Preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview)
1. [Review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request) [pull requests](https://github.com/advanced-computing/course-materials/pulls)

## Data Engineering

- Lots of emphasis on the data and stuff you can do with it (in the world); not as much around how to get and manage it
- Repeatability
- Reliability
- Access

---

## Scope

From [Computing in Context](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/), we're going:

### Deep

Better understanding what we've learned.

- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Web development
- etc.

---

### Broad

Understanding things around code/data.

- Collaborating on code (GitHub)
- Project/product management
- Automated testing
- Databases
- Data engineering
- Infrastructure
- Privacy

---

## Overall goal

We'll be building a data system that:

- Pull in latest data on a regular basis
- Clean it in an automated way
- Collect it in a database
- Show up-to-date information from the database in a web app
- Send alerts if there are issues

---

## Project teams

Thinking teams of two; let me know ASAP if you have enemies.

## Generative AI policy

[SIPA guidance:](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/teaching-guide/#teachingresourcestext)

> Consider the continuum of policies: (a) Use of Generative AI is prohibited … (c) Use freely with acknowledgment and disclosure.

What are the considerations for that spectrum?

---

### Considerations

- Ubiquity
- Understanding of material
- Accuracy
- Equity
