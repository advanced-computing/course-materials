### Deep

Better understanding what we've learned.

### Broad

Understanding things around code/data.

- Collaborating on code (GitHub)
- Project/product management
- Automated testing
- Databases

## Overall goal

We'll be building a data system that:

- Pull in latest data on a regular basis

- Collect it in a database
- Show up-to-date information from the database in a web app
- Send alerts if there are issues
