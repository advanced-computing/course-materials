# Lecture 12 - IN PROGRESS

**Infrastructure / cloud computing**

---

## Agenda

1. Technical stuff
1. Zooming out

---

## Infrastructure

There are whole certifications/careers on this stuff; we're just scratching the surface.

---

## Terms

- Workload
- Server
- Compute
- Storage
  - Disk
  - Blob
- Region

---

### Networking

- Local area network (LAN)
- Wide area network (WAN)
- Virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
  - IPv4
  - IPv6

---

#### Demo

- `dig <domain>`
- Show router info

---

## Containers

- Docker
  - Like [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with greater isolation+portability
- Registry
- Kubernetes

---

## [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

---

### Demo

1. Create a Project.
1. Grant everyone (`advanced-computing-for-policy-all@columbia.edu`) Viewer access.
1. Re-run.
1. Create a BigQuery dataset and table.
1. Change access to just the dataset.
1. Change the dataset name.

---

- Configuration as code (CaC)
- Infrastructure as code (IaC)

Why might these be useful?

---

Why are we talking about all of this? How does it relate to policy?

---

> The magic of law is now inextricably tied to the bits and bytes of computer code.
