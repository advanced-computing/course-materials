## [Project Part 2](../docs/project.md#part-2)

How did it go?

---

## How do you know your code works?

---

## Example

We want to normalize phone numbers. What situations do we need to handle?

---

1. Create a function
1. Try the different test cases
1. Make them pass

---

- `print()`
- `assert`
- Loop

---

## Unit testing

- inputs → function → expected outputs
- Generally testing small chunks of code
- Generally should work offline, i.e. not talk to an API or anything

---

### [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)

Structured way of doing what we were already doing

---

## Profiling

[Examples](lecture_05_profiling.ipynb)

---

## Data cleaning

1. Add tests for parsing the dollar amount
1. Make them pass

---

## Data quality checks

- Can be flexible, like checking for standard deviation or X% matching certain criteria
- There are tools that help with this
