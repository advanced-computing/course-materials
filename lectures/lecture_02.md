# Lecture 2: Project/product management

---

## Agenda

1. Organizing work
1. Waterfall vs. agile
1. Project management
1. Project kickoff

---

Let's say you have a big project to do — school, work, personal, whatever. How do you go about it?

_Try and avoid jargon._

## [Waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

![Waterfall diagram](../img/waterfall.png)

Royce Winston, ["Managing the Development of Large Software Systems"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/41765.41801), 1970

> the implementation described above is risky and invites failure.

Why?

---

> The testing phase which occurs at the end of the development cycle is the first event for which timing, storage, input/output transfers, etc., are experienced as distinguished from analyzed.

Why is that a problem?

---

> These phenomena are not precisely analyzable. … if these phenomena fail to satisfy the various external constraints, then invariably a major redesign is required. A simple … patch or redo of some isolated code will not fix these kinds of difficulties.

Why is that a problem?

---

> The required design changes are likely to be so disruptive that the software requirements upon which the design is based and which provides the rationale for everything are violated. Either the requirements must be modified, or a substantial change in the design is required. In effect the development process has returned to the origin and one can expect up to a 100-percent overrun in schedule and/or costs.

Why would circular vs. linear help?

## Communication overhead

This works best when teams are:

- Small
  - ["Two-pizza teams"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoPizzaTeam.html)
- High-trust

> Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.

## Continuous delivery

## Types of PM

| Role              | Responsibility    | Boils down to                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Product           | Users/customers   | What is this team trying to do?                |
| Project           | Process/delivery  | Who is doing what when, and what's in the way? |
| Program/Portfolio | Multiple products | What are we doing, collectively?               |

## Kanban

[Came out of Toyota.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)

> One of the main benefits of kanban is to establish an upper limit to work in process (commonly referred as "WIP") inventory to avoid overcapacity.

---

Many, _many_ tools, such as:

- Asana
- GitHub Projects
- Jira
- Monday
- Smartsheet
- Trello

---

Even simpler:

## Scrum

Essentially Kanban with more process.

## The Project

_Bringing it back_

Per the [syllabus](../README.md#course-description):

> Over the semester, students will build a complex end-to-end data system.

What might we need / need to think about?
