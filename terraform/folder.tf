# CUIT doesn't want the projects to exist under the columbia.edu Google Cloud organization, which they manage. Also, don't seem to be able to create in No Organization, due to:
# https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#organizations
# Therefore, create under a different domain.
