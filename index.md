## Course Description

In [Computing in Context](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/), students "explore\[d\] computing concepts and coding in the context of solving policy problems." Building off that foundation of Python fundamentals and data analysis, Advanced Computing for Policy goes both deeper and broader. The course covers computer science concepts like data structures and algorithms, as well as supporting systems like databases, cloud services, and collaboration tools. Over the semester, students will build a complex end-to-end data system. This course prepares students for more advanced data science coursework at SIPA, and equips them to do sophisticated data ingestion, analysis, and presentation in research/industry.

## Prerequisites

[Computing in Context (INAFU6006)](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/)

### Topics

Coming into the course, you're expected to be comfortable with the following:

- Getting Python and Jupyter running locally
- Using Jupyter
- Installing Anaconda packages
- Python
  - Programs as files
  - Types
  - Conditionals and iteration
  - Understanding algorithms
  - Functions
  - Manipulating strings
  - Lists, dictionaries, and sets
  - Reading and writing to files
- Data analysis and visualization in Python (using pandas)
  - See [the Computing in Context syllabus](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/#schedule) for more details.
- How to read API documentation

### Testing out

For Spring 2025 only, during [SIPA's transition to the new Concentrations](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/news/introducing-columbia-sipas-enhanced-curriculum), students can test out of this prerequisite. If you are interested in doing so, please read the following, then [**reach out**](mailto:alf2215@columbia.edu).

Note that this pathway is specific to this course. This test does not waive the Computing in Context prerequisite for other courses, such as [Applying Machine Learning (INAFU6503)](https://vergil.columbia.edu/vergil/course/20251/62323).

#### Test details

The test will:

- Be taken in late December or early January, online, on your own schedule
- Have a time limit of 90 minutes
- Include both multiple choice and free response questions, including questions like:
  - "What would the result of this code be?"
  - "What does this code do, in plain English?"
- Be relatively straightforward if you're comfortable with [the topics above](#topics), very challenging if you're not

You won't be allowed to [register](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/registration/) yourself; once you take and pass the test, the instructor will have you manually added before the start of the semester. **The test must be taken before Jan 17**, and can only be taken once.

#### Coming from [Python for Public Policy](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/syllabus.html)

For those who have taken Python for Public Policy (INAFU6504) but not Computing in Context, you will need to [get more experience with Python fundamentals](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/resources.html#python-fundamentals) before taking the test. This is essentially making up for the extra seven weeks of Python you would have gotten in Computing in Context. In other words: it's possible, but will be a lot of work.

## Grading

- Attendance: 10%
- Technical assignments: 50%
- Reading responses: 20%
- Final Project: 20%

Communication with the instructors is paramount. The instructors are happy to be flexible with requests for extensions made _before the deadlines_. Work that is not submitted by the due date without advance notice and permission from the instructor will be deducted 5% for every day it is late.

Additional assignment scoring details:

- Syntax errors: -10 points
- Incomplete Steps / Steps with logic errors: -2 to -5 points
- Unattempted Steps: -10 points

## Attendance

Attending class is mandatory, but most importantly, important. Learning programming requires commitment from the part of the student and the skills are built out of practice. If you miss an experience in class, you miss an important learning moment and the class misses your contribution.

Missing class counts as an absence, regardless of the reason or notifying the instructor(s) beforehand. Missing more than 20 minutes of a class session will be treated as an absence. The first absence is treated as a "freebie", each subsequent absence will result in a 1% deduction from the overall grade.

If you do miss class, we trust that it's for a good reason. If you're sick, please use that freebie and stay home and rest.

You are responsible for getting caught up on what was covered in class. You may want to ask a classmate for notes.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each lecture and recitation.
