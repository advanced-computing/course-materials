## Course Description

In [Computing in Context](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/), students "explore\[d\] computing concepts and coding in the context of solving policy problems." Building off that foundation of Python fundamentals and data analysis, Advanced Computing for Policy goes both deeper and broader. The course covers computer science concepts like data structures and algorithms, as well as supporting systems like databases, cloud services, and collaboration tools. Over the semester, students will build a complex end-to-end data system. This course prepares students for more advanced data science coursework at SIPA, and equips them to do sophisticated data ingestion, analysis, and presentation in research/industry.

## Prerequisites

## Readings

See the details and links in the schedule below. Books, which are either open access and/or will be placed on [Course Reserves](https://library.columbia.edu/services/reserves.html):

- [Article 19, Knodel, M., Uhlig, U., Oever, N. ten, & Cath, C. (2020). _How the Internet Really Works: An Illustrated Guide to Protocols, Privacy, Censorship, and Governance_ (Illustrated edition). No Starch Press.](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/15236654)
- [LeMay, M. (2022). _Product Management in Practice_ (2nd edition). O'Reilly Media.](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/17923879)

It's likely that you will need to do reading beyond what is assigned to fill in gaps of understanding. If you're having trouble finding a resource, ask!

### Responses

For each set of readings (which might include podcasts/videos), you will submit a response in [Ed](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/210480/external_tools/37606?display=borderless). This might be one or more of:

- A paragraph of reflection
- A list of questions
- A link to a notes doc
- A photo of some [sketchnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchnoting)

Creativity is welcome. The response should do a few things:

- Demonstrate that you did the reading, speaking to / referencing / synthesizing all of them
- Indicate whether the material made sense to you
- Show the instructor/TA where gaps in understanding might be so that we can cover in lecture or subsequent readings
- Encourage discussion

After your initial post, you are encouraged to read and respond to others'.

You can find the rubric under the [Assignment](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/210480/assignments) in Courseworks.

This is a new course; all of the above is subject to change. Things will be adjusted to the needs and interests of the students.

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Attending class (lectures and labs) is mandatory, but most importantly, important. Learning programming requires commitment from the part of the student and the skills are built out of practice. If you miss an experience in class, you miss an important learning moment and the class misses your contribution.

Missing class counts as an absence, regardless of the reason or notifying the instructor(s) beforehand. Missing more than 20 minutes of a class session will be treated as an absence. The first two absences are treated as "freebies", each subsequent absence will result in a 0.5% deduction from the overall grade.

If you do miss class, we trust that it's for a good reason. If you're sick, please use that freebie and stay home and rest.

You are responsible for getting caught up on what was covered in class. You may want to ask a classmate for notes.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each lecture and recitation.

### Academic Integrity

For individually-submitted assignments: A student may work with other students. However, assignment solutions should not be identical to / copied-and-pasted from one another, and each student should submit theirs separately. In addition, students need to indicate who they worked with with each submission.

Similarly, it is common practice to use code snippets found on the internet; these sources must be cited.

#### Generative AI

[To be co-developed with the students](lectures/lecture_01.md#generative-ai-policy)

#### SIPA Academic Integrity Statement

The School of International & Public Affairs does not tolerate cheating or plagiarism in any form. Students who violate the Code of Academic & Professional Conduct will be subject to the Dean's Disciplinary Procedures.

Please familiarize yourself with the proper methods of citation and attribution. The School provides some valuable resources online; we strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with these various styles before conducting research. Cut and paste the following link into your browser to view the Code of Academic & Professional Conduct and to access useful resources on citation and attribution: [http://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/academic-policies/](http://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/academic-policies/)

Violations of the Code of Academic & Professional Conduct should be reported to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs.

### SIPA Disability Statement

SIPA is committed to ensuring that students registered with [Columbia University's Disability Services](https://health.columbia.edu/content/disability-services) (DS) receive the reasonable accommodations necessary to participate fully in their academic programs. If you are a student with a disability and have a DS-certified accommodation letter, you may wish to make an appointment with your course instructor to discuss your accommodations. Faculty provide disability accommodations to students with DS-certified accommodation letters, and they provide the accommodations specified in such letters. If you have any additional questions, please contact SIPA's DS liaison at [disability@sipa.columbia.edu](mailto:disability@sipa.columbia.edu) or 212-854-8690.
