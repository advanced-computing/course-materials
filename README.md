## Course Description

In [Computing in Context](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/), students "explore\[d\] computing concepts and coding in the context of solving policy problems." Building off that foundation of Python fundamentals and data analysis, Advanced Computing for Policy goes both deeper and broader. The course covers computer science concepts like data structures and algorithms, as well as supporting systems like databases, cloud services, and collaboration tools. Over the semester, students will build a complex end-to-end data system. This course prepares students for more advanced data science coursework at SIPA, and equips them to do sophisticated data ingestion, analysis, and presentation in research/industry.

## Prerequisites

[Computing in Context (INAFU6006)](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/). See [info about testing out](testing_out.md).

## Grading

- Attendance: 10%
- Technical assignments: 50%
- Reading responses: 20%
- Final Project: 20%

Communication with the instructors is paramount. The instructors are happy to be flexible with requests for extensions made _before the deadlines_. Work that is not submitted by the due date without advance notice and permission from the instructor will be deducted 5% for every day it is late.

Additional assignment scoring details:

- Syntax errors: -10 points
- Incomplete Steps / Steps with logic errors: -2 to -5 points
- Unattempted Steps: -10 points

## Attendance

Attending class is mandatory, but most importantly, important. Learning programming requires commitment from the part of the student and the skills are built out of practice. If you miss an experience in class, you miss an important learning moment and the class misses your contribution.

Missing class counts as an absence, regardless of the reason or notifying the instructor(s) beforehand. Missing more than 20 minutes of a class session will be treated as an absence. The first absence is treated as a "freebie", each subsequent absence will result in a 1% deduction from the overall grade.

If you do miss class, we trust that it's for a good reason. If you're sick, please use that freebie and stay home and rest.

You are responsible for getting caught up on what was covered in class. You may want to ask a classmate for notes.

You are expected to bring a laptop to each lecture and recitation.
