Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?

I initially took this class because Python is now a must-have skill, but I ended up really enjoying working with data. I would like to be able to conceptualize and tackle big analytical problems with the help of data & Python - it's an empowering feeling.

My dream job would involve travelling and working on finance deals that promote economic development in emerging economies and/or are related to geopolitical strategy. 

Favorite snack: Pastries or berries
