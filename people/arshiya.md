Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?

I am taking this class because I want to build on the foundation from Computing in Context and be confident analyzing data in Python.
My dream job is to be a Wedding Organizer (in 20 years)! Medium term - I want to work as an analyst in Economic Consulting, particularly in Antitrust and Competition Economics.

Favorite snack: Red Doritos
