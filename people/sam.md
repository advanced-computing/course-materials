**Why are you in this class? Do you have a dream project/job?**

I'm in this class because I want to be able to apply Python and Pandas to data analysis in the financial markets and monetary policy spaces.

This winter break I worked on a Python project in which I mapped an Efficient Frontier for a portfolio of assets.

**Favorite snack:** Mallomars
