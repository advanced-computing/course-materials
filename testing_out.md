# Testing out

Coming into the course, you're expected to be comfortable with the following:

- Getting Python and Jupyter running locally
- Using Jupyter
- Markdown
- Installing Anaconda packages
- Python
  - Programs as files
  - Types
  - Conditionals and iteration
  - Understanding algorithms
  - Functions
  - Manipulating strings
  - Lists, dictionaries, and sets
  - Reading and writing to files
- Data analysis and visualization in Python (using pandas)
  - See [the Computing in Context syllabus](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/#schedule) for more details.
- How to read API documentation

For Spring 2025 only, during [SIPA's transition to the new Concentrations](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/news/introducing-columbia-sipas-enhanced-curriculum), students can test out of [the prerequisite](README.md#prerequisites). If you are interested in doing so, please read the following, then [**reach out**](mailto:alf2215@columbia.edu).

Note that this pathway is specific to this course. This test does not waive the Computing in Context prerequisite for other courses, such as [Applying Machine Learning (INAFU6503)](https://vergil.columbia.edu/vergil/course/20251/62323).

## Test details

The test will:

- Be taken in late December or early January, online, on your own schedule
- Have a time limit of 90 minutes
- Include both multiple choice and free response questions, including questions like:
  - "What would the result of this code be?"
  - "What does this code do, in plain English?"
- Be relatively straightforward if you're comfortable with the topics above, very challenging if you're not

You won't be allowed to [register](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/sipa/registration/) yourself; once you take and pass the test, the instructor will have you manually added before the start of the semester. **The deadline for the test is January 17th**, and can only be taken once.

## Coming from [Python for Public Policy](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/syllabus.html)

For those who have taken Python for Public Policy (INAFU6504) but not Computing in Context, you will need to [get more experience with Python fundamentals](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/resources.html#python-fundamentals) before taking the test. This is essentially making up for the extra seven weeks of Python you would have gotten in Computing in Context. In other words: it's possible, but will be a lot of work.
