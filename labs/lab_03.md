# Lab 3

---

## Objectives

Students:

- Get the repository that they'll be building their Projects in set up
- Practice working collaboratively in a repository

---

## [Project team](../docs/project.md#teams) repository setup

1. [Create a public repository in the `advanced-computing` organization.](https://github.com/new?owner=advanced-computing&visibility=public)
   - Make the name something distinctive, such as:
     - What your project is focused on
     - Your celebrity couple name
     - A combination of your favorite snacks
     - The name your automation will assume once it becomes sentient
1. [`.gitignore`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files#configuring-ignored-files-for-a-single-repository)
   1. Demo
      - Explain what it does and what it's for
   1. [Set one up for Python and Mac (if applicable)](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore?templates=macos,python)

---

## Pull request practice

Have them trade off sending and reviewing pull requests to add:

- The notebook from [Part 1](../docs/project.md#part-1)
- A README

The notebook may not (fully) render, due to having interactivity. They can test with the GitHub URL in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/)/[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

---

## TODOs

Have each group [create issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) for the things that came up in [the brainstorming](../lectures/lecture_02.md#the-project). They should add objectives / [acceptance criteria](https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/project-management/acceptance-criteria) for each. (These can change later.)
