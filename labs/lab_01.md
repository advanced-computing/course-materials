## Objectives

Students:

---

## Setup

We're going to go through and make sure you have the following installed / set up:

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- On Windows, there are a _lot_ of options in the installer - safe to stick to the defaults.
- Set global [name](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git) and [email](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git)

```
git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
git config --global user.email "ml1234@columbia.edu"
```

---

### [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- On Windows, in the [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/getting-started), [`Select Default Profile`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/profiles) to be `Git BASH`.

If you did all the following:

- took [Computing in Context](https://computing-in-context.afeld.me/)
- have the same computer
- didn't uninstall any of the development tools

â€¦then you should be all set.
