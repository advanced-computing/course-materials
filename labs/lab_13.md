# Lab 13

**Cloud-based pipelines**

You'll be working with your [Project team](../docs/project_teams.csv).

---

## Goal

Your regularly-updated data is being pulled in automatically

---

GitHub Actions ➡️ Python ➡️ BigQuery

---

Make a workflow that runs on a [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run your ETL. Check out [the workflows in this repository](../.github/workflows/) as examples you can start with.

---

## Thinking ahead

- How will you know if it worked?
- If something went wrong, where would you look to find out why?

## Hints

<details>
   <summary>There's an extra step</summary>

## Tips

- To test out the workflow, you can:
  - Make the schedule more frequent
  - Set it to `push`
  - [Run it manually](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow)
  - Advanced: [Run it locally](https://nektosact.com/)
- To protect yourself in case your data gets messed up:
  - Set up [table snapshots](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/table-snapshots-intro).
  - Make separate test and production datasets/tables in BigQuery.
