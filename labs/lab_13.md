# Lab 13

**Cloud-based pipelines**

You'll be working with your [Project team](../docs/project_teams.csv).

---

## Goal

Your regularly-updated data is being pulled in automatically

---

GitHub Actions ➡️ Python ➡️ BigQuery

---

Back in [Lab 6](lab_06.md#steps), you set up automated testing. Use that as a template to make another workflow that runs on a [schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) for ETL.

---

## Optional

Get the workflow running locally with [act](https://nektosact.com/)
