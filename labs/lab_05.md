# Lab 5

## Objective

Get hands-on experience with:

- Unit testing
- Data profiling
- Data quality checks

---

## Steps

You'll [pair](../docs/pairing.md) in your group, repository, and dataset from [Lab 4](lab_04.md). Work on branches and submit pull requests for the chunks of work â€” you decide what the "chunks" are.

---

### Data profiling

[Set up YData Profiling](../lectures/lecture_05_profiling.ipynb#ydata-profiling) for your dataset. If it's slow, see [their documentation on profiling large datasets](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/big_data/).

---

### [Data quality checks](../lectures/lecture_05.md#data-quality-checks)

Set up at least three different data quality checks with pytest.
