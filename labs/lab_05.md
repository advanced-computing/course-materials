# Lab 5 - IN PROGRESS

## Objective

Get hands-on experience with:

- Unit testing
- Data profiling
- Data quality checks

---

## Steps

You'll [pair](../docs/pairing.md) in your [Project teams](../docs/project.md#teams). Work on branches and submit pull requests for the chunks of work â€” you decide what the "chunks" are.

---

### Unit testing

Without writing any code:

1. Review your existing code.
   - What can be refactored into functions?
   - Where can we make our code [DRY](https://dzone.com/articles/is-your-code-dry-or-wet)?
1. Decide what function you're going to create.
1. Come up with test cases (inputs) and expected outputs.
   - This can be in a text file, doc, piece of paper, etc.

---

Then, as code:

1. Write tests.
1. Confirm they fail.
1. Refactor your code into the function.
1. Make the tests pass.

### Data profiling

[Set up YData Profiling](../lectures/lecture_05_profiling.ipynb#ydata-profiling) for your dataset. If it's slow, see [their documentation on profiling large datasets](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/latest/features/big_data/).
