# Lab 7

## Objective

Get experience writing data to and reading data from a database

---

You'll [pair](../docs/pairing.md) in your group, repository, and dataset from Labs [4](lab_04.md) and [5](lab_05.md). Work on branches and submit pull requests for the chunks of work â€” you decide what the "chunks" are.

---

You'll be changing your API over to use DuckDB.

1. Install the [Python client](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/python/overview#installation).
1. Create a [Python](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/python/overview) or [SQL](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview#non-interactive-usage) script to [write data](../lectures/lecture_07.md#writing-data) to a [persistent database](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/python/overview#persistent-storage).
