# Lab 11 - IN PROGRESS

---

You'll be working in your [Project team](../docs/project_teams.csv).

---

Visually map your data flow, end to end.

- You can use:
  - Paper
  - [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings)
  - Something fancier
    - Don't over-complicate this
- What happens at each step?
- What can go wrong?

---

- Get granular
- Instead of starting with downloading data, can you go further upstream?
