# Lab 11

Sit with your [Project team](../docs/project_teams.csv).

## [Usability testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/)

Your Project team is going to pair up with another one, being each others' test facilitators and participants. You'll be checking/validating the usability of the code, documentation, and site.

---

### Roles

#### Facilitators

The Project owners will be the facilitators. Facilitators will:

- Do as little speaking, pointing, grimacing, etc. as possible
- Take notes
  - What are participants getting confused by / stuck on?
  - What can be clearer?

#### Participants

The other team are the test participants. Participants set up and review the Project, thinking out loud.

---

### Steps

1. Pick one Project to test first. Participants will do the subsequent steps.
1. Set up the Project.
   - Get the app running locally; you don't need to deploy it.
   - Timebox this to 20 minutes.
   - The Google Cloud Project identifier may need to be changed to your team's; otherwise, avoid changing any code if you can.
1. Load the data.
1. Review the site.
   - If you're unable to get it running locally, you can look at [the published site](../docs/project_teams.csv).
   - What is the site trying to convey?
   - What are your takeaways?
1. Repeat for the other Project.
1. Regroup with your Project team. Discuss your takeaways, making GitHub issues for those TODOs.

## Mapping the data flow

In your Project team, visually map your data flow, end to end.

- What happens at each step?
- What can go wrong?
- You can use:
  - Paper
  - [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings)
  - A fancier diagramming tool
    - Don't over-complicate this

---

- Get granular
- Go all the way upstream. How does the data get collected/generated?
