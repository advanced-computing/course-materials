# Lab 11

Sit with your [Project team](../docs/project_teams.csv).

---

## Objective

Ensure our Project setup instructions, code, and analysis are clear

---

## Document

_10 minutes_

[Pair](../docs/pairing.md) in your Project team to add setup instructions to your README, taking someone from zero to the app running with populated data. You can assume they:

- Know Python
- Are comfortable in the command line

Send pull request(s) and merge.

## [Usability testing](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/)

Your Project team is going to pair up with another one, being each others' test facilitators and participants. You'll be checking/validating the usability of the code, documentation, and site.

---

### Roles

#### Facilitators

The Project owners will be the facilitators. Facilitators will:

- Do as little speaking, pointing, grimacing, etc. as possible
- Take notes
  - What are participants getting confused by / stuck on?
  - What steps did they need to take that aren't documented (well)?
  - What can be clearer?

#### Participants

The other team are the test participants. The task is to set up and review the Project, thinking out loud.

### Steps

_30 minutes for each Project with break in between_

1. Pick one Project to test first.
1. Participants will:
   1. Set up the Project.
      - Get the app running locally; you don't need to deploy it.
      - Try to follow the instructions exactly, only going back to perform missing steps when you hit a problem.
      - Everyone _should_ have read-only access to each others' BigQuery.
      - Timebox this to 20 minutes.
   1. Load the data.
      - The Google Cloud Project identifier will need to be changed to your team's; avoid changing any other code if you can.
   1. Review the site.
      - If you're unable to get it running locally, you can look at [the published site](../docs/project_teams.csv).
      - What is the site trying to convey?
      - What are your takeaways?
1. Repeat for the other Project, switching roles.

---

### Regroup

_Remaining time_

In your Project team:

1. Discuss your takeaways.
1. Revise your code/documentation.
1. Send pull request(s) and merge.
