# Lab 10

**Objective:** Think through data loading for different data sources

---

Work in your [Project team](../docs/project_teams.csv) to load your other datasets to BigQuery. For each data source:

1. What type of [data loading](lab_08.md#data-loading) will you use? Why? Explain as Markdown in your repository.
1. Create a data loading script, repeating those steps from [Part 5](../docs/project.md#part-5).
